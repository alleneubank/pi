# Use Pi in the terminal

Run `pi` from the folder you want to work in. Pi uses that folder to discover files, instructions, and configuration, and to group saved sessions. If you have not installed Pi or chosen a model yet, follow the [Quickstart](quickstart.md).

Pi may ask whether you trust the working folder before loading its project resources. See [Project trust](security.md#understand-project-trust).

The transcript shows your prompts, Pi's responses, tool calls, results, and errors. You write prompts and commands in the editor. The footer shows the current folder, session, model, context usage, and accumulated usage and cost.

## Enter a prompt

Type a request and press `Enter` to send it. Use `Shift+Enter` to add a line, or press `Ctrl+G` to work on a longer prompt in your configured external editor.

To include files or images:

- Type `@` to search for a file and add it to your prompt.
- Press `Tab` to complete a path.
- Paste an image or drag it into a compatible terminal.

## Follow Pi's work

Pi shows each tool call and result while it works. Press `Ctrl+O` to expand or collapse tool output. Press `Ctrl+T` to show or hide thinking blocks.

The startup header lists the instructions and resources Pi loaded. The editor border indicates the current thinking level. The footer updates as the model uses context and reports usage.

Pi does not ask before every tool call. Review commands and changed files, and use a sandbox for untrusted or unattended work. See [Security](security.md).

## Change direction

You can send more input while Pi is working:

| What you want | Action |
|---|---|
| Adjust the current task | Type a message and press `Enter` |
| Add work after the current task | Type a message and press `Alt+Enter` |
| Return queued messages to the editor | Press `Alt+Up` |
| Stop the current task | Press `Escape` |

A message sent with `Enter` waits until the current response and its tool calls finish, then guides the next response. A follow-up sent with `Alt+Enter` waits until Pi finishes the current task. Aborting returns queued messages to the editor.

Windows Terminal reserves some Alt shortcuts. See [Terminal Setup](terminal-setup.md) for the Windows alternatives.

## Change the model or settings

Type `/` to search the available commands. The commands you will use most often are:

- `/model` selects a model. Press `Ctrl+L` to open the same selector.
- `/thinking` selects how much reasoning the current model uses. Press `Shift+Tab` to cycle through supported levels.
- `/login` and `/logout` manage provider access.
- `/settings` changes common preferences.

Prompt templates, skills, and extensions can add more commands to the same menu. See [Choose a Model](models.md), [Configuration](configuration.md), or the complete [Slash Commands reference](slash-commands.md).

## Continue or start over

Pi saves sessions automatically unless session persistence is disabled.

- `/new` starts a new session.
- `/resume` opens another saved session.
- `/name` gives the current session a recognizable name.
- `/session` shows its file, ID, message count, token usage, and cost.

Use `/tree`, `/fork`, or `/clone` when you want to explore another approach without losing existing work. Use `/compact` to reduce the conversation history sent to the model. See [Sessions and Context](sessions.md) for these workflows.

After leaving Pi, run `pi --continue` from the same folder to resume its most recent session.

## Run a terminal command

Prefix a command with `!` to run it and include its output in the conversation:

```text
!git status
```

Use `!!` when you want to run a command without sending its output to the model.

## Run a background process

The model-callable `bash` tool can set `runInBackground` to return immediately with the process PID, output path, and status path. Otherwise Bash waits for the command to exit; `timeout` remains a separate hard deadline. Press `Shift+Ctrl+B` to move an active model Bash command to the background without restarting it. User `!` and `!!` commands remain in the foreground.

Use `ps` and `kill` to inspect or stop the process, and read its output and status paths for details. `/processes` shows owned process records to the human without sending them to the model. The status file contains `pid`, `state`, `outputPath`, and `startedAt`, with `endedAt`, `exitCode`, `signal`, or `error` when applicable. States are `running`, `exited`, `failed`, `cancelled`, and `timed_out`. A recorded `running` state is not proof of liveness after a crash; a missing file means unknown, not success. Completion does not wake the conversation or send output to the model.

Before an already-scheduled model request, Pi batches unreported completions from retained background records on the active branch into request-only context. Each notice includes the PID, terminal state, exit code or signal when available, and output/status paths, including successful exits with code 0. Pi does not repeat running-process updates or copy logs. After a successful assistant response, those notices are not injected again; failed or aborted responses leave them available for a later attempt. No extra turn is created. Backgrounding allows independent work to overlap; dependent work still requires waiting for completion and inspecting the output.

Background processes belong to the current runtime and session branch. `/reload` preserves them; `/new`, `/resume`, `/fork`, quitting, or runtime disposal cancels them. Finite records remain until eviction or disposal, with limits of 32 running processes, 128 records, and 10 MiB of output per process. Print and JSON modes do not wait for background Bash. For work that must survive Pi, use tmux or another supervisor.

## Copy, export, or share results

Press `Ctrl+X` or run `/copy` to copy the last assistant response. Use `/export` to save the session as HTML or JSONL.

Use `/share` to upload the session and get a viewer link. With Radius authentication, the artifact is visible to your Radius organization. Otherwise, Pi creates a private GitHub gist through the GitHub CLI. Review the session first because it can contain prompts, tool output, file contents, and credentials exposed during the conversation.

## Adjust the terminal

Regular mode uses the terminal's normal scrollback. Fullscreen mode keeps the editor and status area fixed while the transcript scrolls within the terminal window. Choose a mode through `/settings` or `--tui-mode`.

Terminal support for mouse input, keyboard shortcuts, and inline images varies. See [Terminal Setup](terminal-setup.md) for platform-specific configuration and [Keybindings](keybindings.md) for every configurable shortcut. Run `/hotkeys` to inspect the shortcuts active in your current session.

## Collect diagnostic information

When troubleshooting terminal rendering or conversation state, run `/debug`. Pi writes the rendered terminal lines and current session messages to `pi-debug.log` in your [agent directory](configuration.md#agent-directory).

Review this file before sharing it. It can contain prompts, model responses, tool output, file contents, and terminal data.
